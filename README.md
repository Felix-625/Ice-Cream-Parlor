# Ice-Cream-Parlor

This code solves the "Ice Cream Parlor" problem by finding two ice cream flavors whose prices sum to a given amount. It uses a dictionary to store each price and its index while iterating through the list, checking if the complement needed to reach the target sum has already been seen. When a valid pair is found, it returns their 1-based indices in ascending order.
